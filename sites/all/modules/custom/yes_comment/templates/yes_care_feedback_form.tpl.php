<h2>Speak up for better health care!</h2>
<p>We want to hear what you think about your health care and services under the One Care plan--including both positive and negative experiences you’ve had.</p>
<p>Your feedback will help One Care providers know if they are meeting your needs. It will also help them to improve the care they provide. </p>
<p><strong>Your comments are private.</strong> Health care providers will not be able to log in to this website and will not know who gave us feedback.</p>
<p>If you can, please let us know:</p>
<div class="feedback-form callout-padding">
  <?php print render( $form['provider_name'] ); ?>
  <?php print render( $form['provider_practice'] ); ?>
  <p>If you don't have this information, we still want your comments</p>
  <?php print render( $form['feedback_box'] ); ?>
  <p><small><em>YES Health does not resolve individual health care or One Care disputes or problems directly. </em></small></p>
